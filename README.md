# Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Benedict

I enjoy coding, researching and beeing outdoors ðŸ˜Š

I am currently studying at the DHBW Karlsruhe with SAP as a partner.
My interest in modern technologies has grown expnentially over the last few years, which is why you will find many of my projects are written in Rust.

Feel free to have a look around!
